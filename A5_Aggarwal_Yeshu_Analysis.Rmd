## PART I

###Import Data

```{r}
Data<-read.csv("C:/Users/yeshu/Desktop/A5_Aggarwal_Yeshu_Sequences.csv")
```

```{r}
Data
```
### Count the number of each base pair (A, T, C and G), in each of the three sequences.

```{r}
Count_A<- nchar(as.character(Data$Sequence)) -nchar(gsub("A", "", Data$Sequence))
print(Count_A)
```

```{r}
Count_T<-nchar(as.character(Data$Sequence)) -nchar(gsub("T", "", Data$Sequence))
print(Count_T)
```
```{r}
Count_G<-nchar(as.character(Data$Sequence)) -nchar(gsub("G", "", Data$Sequence))
print(Count_G)
```

```{r}
Count_C<-nchar(as.character(Data$Sequence)) -nchar(gsub("C", "", Data$Sequence))
print(Count_C)
```
```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

### Print out the number of each nucleotide as a table for each of the three sequences.

```{r}
Data<- Data %>%
  mutate(Count_A, Count_T, Count_G, Count_C)
Data
```

### Include an image of a bacteria from the internet, and a link to the Wikipedia page about Borrelia burgdorferi.

### Calculate GC Content (% of nucleotides that are G or C) and create a final table showing GC content for each sequence ID.

```{r}
GC_content<- Count_G + Count_C
GC_content
```
```{r}
Total<- Count_A + Count_C + Count_T + Count_G
Total
```

```{r}
Data<- Data %>%
  mutate(Sequence_ID_GC_Content = (GC_content/Total)*100)
Data
```
